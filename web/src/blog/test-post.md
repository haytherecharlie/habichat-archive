title: 'Creating A Blog Using Gatsby And Firebase Hosting'
---

I have been a fan of Wes Bos since 2015 when I first streamed his course on ES6 - I was just a junior developer at Disney back then - but I knew the concepts he was teaching were extremely important for my career.

Today, I'm a senior developer. I make architectural decisions for a myriad of applications built in both Node and React. Yet, I still find myself suffering from the developer's fallacy - I sometimes think I know better than others. So when Wes told me that he built his blog in Gatsby JS, I quaffed at the idea of using a framework for _beginners_.

But, thankfully, I got over myself and I gave Gatsby a try.

```javascript
function(hello) {
  console.log('hello')
}
```

```css
body {
  background: orange;
}
```

```html
<div>hello</div>
```
